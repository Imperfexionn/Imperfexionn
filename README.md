# Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is ![Imperfexion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Imperfexion-%235bb450?style=for-the-badge)

3D modeler, programmer, and most [not] probably a game developer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was enticed into the broad field of computers at a very young age. Instead of silently appreciating my work being done, I wanted to understand how it was done. That single thought opened up countless paths for me to explore. Over time, my curiosity turned into passion, whether it was learning how programs work behind the scenes or figuring out the logic that empowers them. Around the same period, 3D modeling also caught my attention, and I instantly grabbed onto it. The idea of creating something from scratch, from a literal blank space to a detailed model , hella fascinating for someone like me.

Now, I keep exploring, learning, and experimenting whether it’s building something through code or shaping it in 3D. Every project I work on adds another piece to the repertoire of what I truly want to create in the future. ^-^

* 🌍  I'm based in Earth.
* 💬  Ask me about I'm also a flash game enthusiast if that matters. T-T
